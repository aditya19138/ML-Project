# Indentifying Tags from Stackoverflow Questions

by **Aditya Gupta** and **Aditya Gupta** for course Machine Learning (CSE343/ECE343) under the guidance of **Dr. Saket Anand** from **Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi**.

## Introduction
In information retrieval and natural language
processing, assigning keywords is a critical activity.
Automated tagging is a subtype of keyword assignment
and a sort of **Multi-label text classification** problem in and of itself, with
applications in online forums and automated document
screening.  
Stack Overflow is the largest, most trusted online
community for developers to learn, share their
programming knowledge, and build their careers. Stack
Overflow is something which every programmer use one
way or another. In this study, we predicted the tags based
on the content of the questions posted on the forum. We
used Logistic Regression, SGDClassifier,SVM, RandomForestClassifier,LSTM with glove and  BERT in order to predict
tags.
